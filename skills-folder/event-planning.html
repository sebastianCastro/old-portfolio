    <h1>Projects Management</h1>
    <!-- <p>
      My Google Project Management certification is currently being worked on and will be finished by April 2023. <br>
      Here's an overview of the course, as well as some projects that required me to use some project management skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program teaches a focused skill set designed specifically to enhance an understanding of basic project management. It also qualifies me for over 100 hours of project management education, preparing me for additional professional project management certifications such as PMI-ACP and CAPM. The courses include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The foundations of agile project management, with a focus on implementing Scrum events, building Scrum artifacts, and understanding Scrum roles.</li>
      <li>An immersive understanding of the practices and skills needed to succeed in an entry-level project management role.</li>
      <li>How to create effective project documentation and artifacts throughout the various phases of a project.</li>
    </ul> -->
    <h3>TedX Event</h3>

    <p>
      I organized a TEDx collaboration with our school, creating a one-hour experience of three different talks for all of my schoolmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project began when I decided to pitch an idea to the director of my city's Tedx talk that year. 
      The concept was to promote their event at our school, with the benefits being that the Tedx main event would receive free advertising directly to their target audience, and my classmates would have a great time hearing new and inspiring ideas.
    </p>
    <h3>Time Capsule</h3>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items:flex-start; flex-direction:column">

    </div>
    <p>
    Our students' association needed an activity to wrap up the year, and I proposed organizing a school time capsule; as soon as my peers heard the idea, they were all on board.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most difficult challenge we faced was that we planned too fast and thought that any container would suffice, but it turned out that if we wanted the time capsule to preserve everyone's belongings for many years, it had to be made of a special airtight metal. There was only one company making them, and they were also based in the United States, which created a budget problem. One-third of our budget was going to be spent on shipping it from the United States to Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
    We solved the problem by discussing it with the vendor, who said they could assist us with a special discount. <br> Now that the budget difference was smaller, we decided to seek more funding by speaking with the student association's head teacher. After explaining the problem and informing him about the discount we received, our head teacher approved the new budget, and we were finally able to inform students about the event and appoint someone in each classroom in charge of collecting every student's items. <br>
