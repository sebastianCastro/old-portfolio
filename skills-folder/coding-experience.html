    <p>
        When I first got interested in coding, during my first year abroad 
        studying Chinese, I purchased an Arduino starter kit. Over the course of a month, 
        I would come back to my dorm and learn how to code an Arduino; by the end of that month, 
        I had a good understanding of the basics.
    </p>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my first semester in university, my class took an introduction to programming 
        using Python. Throughout the course of that semester, I got to really enjoy programming 
        and treating each assignment as a little puzzle helped me maintain an interest in this class. <br> 
        Although not very in-depth, the course was still challenging for some students, and so during 
        that semester I helped two classmates review what was being taught in class. <br>
        Here are two examples of assignments from the class.
