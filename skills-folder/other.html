  <h3>DJing</h3>
  <p>
    I've always enjoyed being the guy everyone turns to for new music; I began as the "music guy" in my friend's group. 
    Always had music blasting from somewhere, the excitement of discovering new bangers, and seeing everyone enjoy and dance. <br>
    Back in my second semester in China, I purchased my first DJ controller, learned how to DJ in my dorm room, and then landed my first 
    gig at a local bar called Basement. <br> Back in my hometown, I'm currently performing at friend's parties with a friend under the name "Bring A Friend". 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's simply a hobby that I really enjoy.

  <h3>Juggling</h3>
  <p>
    For some reason, I became interested in juggling during high school, and within a week of deciding 
    I wanted to learn, I was juggling three balls in the air. But I didn't stop there; as my interest 
    grew, I settled to stop juggling, or at least learn how to, once I could juggle seven balls in the air. <br>
    So I kept increasing the number of balls I was juggling until, a year after I first began learning, I was able to juggle seven balls in the air.

  <h3>Dvorak Layout</h3>
  <p>
    Yours and everyone else's keyboards are standard QWERTY layouts, but mine is a Dvorak layout, which was designed to reduce the distance your fingers travel on the keyboard. I used to type with only my two index fingers on QWERTY, but with Dvorak, I can not only use all of my fingers, but I can also touchtype, which is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard. <br> My current average word count per minute is sixty-four.
  </p>
  <h3>Ant-keeping</h3>
  <p>
    As a kid, I used to fill carboys with sand and then go to the park with a spoon, 
    catching many worker ants and putting them inside the carboy, forming my very own anthill. <br>
    I loved seeing their tunnels and feeding them, but they always died, which I never understood. 
    I thought I gave them too much food or water, but a few years ago, I discovered that it 
    is possible to catch a queen ant after their "nuptial flights," which rekindled my interest in the world of ants. <br>
    So I started researching how to catch a queen ant, and three months later, on June 1st 2017, after one of the year's first rains, I finally found a queen ant of the species Pogonomyrmex Rugosus.

  <h3><em style="font-size: 10px;">Not malicious</em> Lock picking</h3>
  <p>
    It all started with curiosity, just like any other hobby of mine. I wanted to see how difficult it was to lockpick a lock, 
    so I purchased a learner's kit that included a transparent lock to show how an average lockÂ mechanism works, five basic lock picks, 
    and a tension tool. I decided that once I could open every lock in my house, I'd be able to say I'd learned how to lock pick. To be honest, 
    it's something that can be learned frighteningly quickly and easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few months after learning, I received a phone call from my father asking me to look for a set of keys in the house; he was away and thought he had forgotten the keys to that place at home.
    I looked for the keys but had no luck, so I called him and told him that they were nowhere to be found at home. But then I suggested that we try to lock pick the door he needed to open. <br>
    I got that door open after thirty minutes.
